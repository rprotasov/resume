My resume (and budding CV) in LaTeX.

It's based on the template by Thomas Janson based on their [blog post](http://www.tjansson.dk/2009/03/writing-a-cv-in-latex/) with a few of my own modifications.

To get a pdf version, from inside the directory, run:

```
$ pdflatex main.tex
```

Additionaly, you can add both `main.tex` and `resume.cls` into an editor such as [sharelatex](https://www.sharelatex.com).
